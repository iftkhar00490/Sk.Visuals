  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p><strong>HTML</strong> <small>(since 2018)</small></p>
  <p> 
   My First Experience of coding was sparked in my 8th grade when i was first introduced to a computer , i would come from school and just try to make one website every day until one day i got into JS and started to code with smoothness and while have mastered it completely i have made much improvments ever since.
  </p>
  <p><strong>UI/UX</strong> <small>(since 2021)</small></p>
  <p>
    after completing my 10th in 2021 Jan i would code websites but that just couldn't get any better so in june 2021 i went to udemy and enrolled a course from ZTM </p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-web-designer-mobile-designer-zero-to-mastery/?kw=ui%2Fux&src=sac" style="color: burlywood; font-size:45px;">Click here to view the course    </a></p>
  
  <p><strong>Python</strong> <small>(since 2021)</small></p>
  <p>
    Python has always been fun to code something that is 99% from pure scratch and it has been skyrocketing the level of entusiasm ever since. I am to able work on platforms such as streamlit, tensorflow, jupyter notebook , replit, i have worked on modules like kivy lib and many more.
