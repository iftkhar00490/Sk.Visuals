<h2>What IS f1 in Schools</h2>
<p>F1 in Schools is a global challenge in which teams of students deploy 
  CAD/CAM software to collaborate, design, analyze, manufacture, test, and

<p>The challenge inspires students to use IT to learn about physics, 
  aerodynamics, design, manufacture, branding, graphics, sponsorship, 
  marketing, leadership/teamwork, media skills and financial strategy, and 
  apply them in a practical, imaginative, competitive and exciting way.
